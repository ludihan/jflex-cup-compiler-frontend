# How to use the build script :
Run the script with a posix shell (like bash) providing an argument:
```sh
sh build.sh <argument>
```

The argument can be one of the following:
- etapa1: Builds and runs first step
- etapa2: Builds and runs second step
- etapa3: Builds and runs third step
- clean: Deletes any residual files from previous builds
